Restoration Simulation – ArcGIS 10.8

Objective:
To simulate ecological restoration of the Tchipou quarry site (14 ha) through tree planting, using a 15 meter planting interval to visualize reforestation potential.

Tools Used:
- ArcMap 10.8
- Spatial Analyst toolbox
- Data Management toolbox
- Quarry boundary polygon
- NDVI raster (2025)
- Slope raster 

Steps:

1. Data Preparation:
- Loaded the following layers into ArcMap:
  - Quarry boundary shapefile 
  - NDVI raster 
  - Slope raster 

2. Identifying Suitable Areas:
- Used Raster Calculator to isolate zones where:
  - NDVI < 0.25 indicating degraded land
  - Slope < 46° safe for planting
Formula used:
  Con(("NDVI_2025" < 0.25) & ("Slope" < 46), 1, 0)
- Output was a binary raster ("1" = suitable planting zones)

3. Raster to Polygon:
- Converted the binary raster to a polygon using:
  Conversion Tools > From Raster > Raster to Polygon
- Output: "plantable_area_polygon"

4. Creating the Planting Grid:
- Used Data Management > Sampling > Create Fishnet
- Parameters:
  - Cell Size Width: 15 meters
  - Cell Size Height: 15 meters
  - Extent: matched quarry site boundary
  - Output type: POLYGON

5. Generating Planting Points:
- Converted the grid polygons to centroid points using:
  Data Management > Features > Feature to Point
- Output: regular grid of points, each representing one tree

6. Clipping Points to Suitable Planting Zones:
- Used Analysis Tools > Extract > Clip
- Input Features: tree point layer
- Clip Feature: plantable_area_polygon
- Result: final tree planting simulation layer

7. Output and Interpretation:
- Total number of tree points: 141
- Each tree spaced at 20m → 1 tree per 225 m²
- Total restorable area: 31725 m²
- Map exported as restoration simulation jpg
- Trees symbolised using trees icons

Notes:
- This simulation does not yet account for local species types, soil fertility, or community priorities.
- It serves as a baseline spatial model to guide ecological rehabilitation and policy recommendations.
