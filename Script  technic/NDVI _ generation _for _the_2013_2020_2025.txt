NDVI Calculation – QGIS 3.24.3

Objective:
To compute and analyse the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the Tchipou quarry site using Landsat 8 AND  Sentinel-2 imagery for the years 2013, 2020, and 2025. This analysis was used to assess vegetation degradation due to industrial mining activities.

Tools Used:
- QGIS 3.24.3
- Raster Calculator
- 

Steps:

1. Data Preparation:
- Downloaded Landsat 8 imagery from USGS explorer for the year 2013 (pre-mining)
- Downloaded Sentinel-2 L1C imagery from Copernicus Open Access Hub for:
  - 2020 (during mining)
  - 2025 (post-mining monitoring)
- Subset the imagery to the study area using a quarry boundary shapefile.

2. Band Selection:
- Identified relevant landsat 8 bands:
  - Band 5 (Near Infrared ) 
  - Band 4 (Red)
- Identified relevant Sentinel-2 bands:
  - Band 8 (Near Infrared ) 
  - Band 4 (Red)

3. NDVI Calculation:
- Used QGIS Raster Calculator to apply the standard NDVI formula:
  
  NDVI = (B8 - B4) / (B8 + B4)

- In Raster Calculator:- Output saved as NDVI_2013.tif, NDVI_2020.tif, NDVI_2025.tif

4. Reclassification:
- Each NDVI layer was reclassified into vegetation categories:
- NDVI 0.37 - 0.63: Dense vegetation
- 0.29–0.36: Moderate vegetation
- 0.22–0.28: Sparse vegetation
- < 0.21: Bare soil / no vegetation
- Reclassification was done using Raster > Reclassify 

5. Visualisation:
- Color-coded NDVI layers using a green gradient (light to dark)
- Compared vegetation cover between 2013, 2020, and 2025
- Exported maps as JPG for use in reports 

6. Output Use:
- NDVI maps were used for:
- Assessing vegetation loss
- Supporting Environmental Justice Score (EJS)
- Guiding restoration simulation model

Notes:
- Atmospheric correction was not applied 
- Accuracy may be affected by cloud cover and seasonal differences
