Slope Map Generation 

Objective:
To generate a high-resolution slope map of the Tchipou quarry site using GPS elevation points collected in the field with a Garmin 64s receiver.

Tools Used:
- ArcMap 10.8
- Excel
- Spatial Analyst toolbox
- 3D Analyst toolbox
- GPS field data (X, Y, Z coordinates)

Steps:

1. Data Collection:
- Field survey was conducted across the quarry site
- A Garmin 64s GPS receiver was used to collect:
  - Longitude (X)
  - Latitude (Y)
  - Elevation (Z)
- The data was saved as a CSV file  using excel and imported into ArcMap

2. Creation of Elevation Points Layer:
- CSV file was added to ArcMap via Add XY Data
- The data was projected into UTM Zone 32N (WGS 84)
- Points were exported as a shapefile named: "Elevation_Points.shp"

3. Interpolation to Create DEM:
- The elevation points were interpolated into a raster surface (DEM)
- Method used: Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)
  Toolbox: 3D Analyst Tools > Raster Interpolation > IDW
- Parameters:
  - Z field: Elevation
  - Output cell size: 1 meters 
- Output: Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

4. Deriving Slope Map:
- The DEM was processed to derive slope values
  Toolbox: Spatial Analyst Tools > Surface > Slope
- Output units: Degree (°)
- Output: “Slope_Map_Quarry.tif”

5. Classification of Slope:
- Slope values were reclassified into 5 classes:
  - Flat (7°)
  - Gentle (17°)
  - Moderate (30°)
  - Steep (45°)
  - Very Steep (79°)
- Toolbox: Spatial Analyst > Reclass > Reclassify

6. Visualisation and Output:
- The classified slope raster was symbolised using a color gradient
- Map layout was created with title, scale, legend, and north arrow
- Map exported in Jpg formats

Notes:
- Slope values were used to:
  - Identify erosion-sensitive zones
  - Determine safe zones for tree planting simulation
  - Contribute to the Environmental Justice Score (EJS)
