Anthropogenic Influence Assessment â€“ ArcMap 10.8

Objective:
To assess the influence of industrial quarrying activities at the Tchipou site on the surrounding human settlements and environment using spatial buffer analysis.

Tools Used:
- ArcMap 10.8
- Analysis Toolbox > Proximity > Buffer
- Shapefiles: Quarry site boundary, Houses, Rivers, Villages

Steps:

1. Input Layers:
- Quarry boundary shapefile (Polygon)
- House locations (Polygon shapefile)
- Village locations (Point shapefile)
- River network (Polyline shapefile)

2. Creating Buffer Zones:
- Used "Buffer" tool from:
  Analysis Tools > Proximity > Buffer
- Input: Quarry polygon
- Buffer distances: 500 meters, 1 kilometer, 2 kilometers
- Output: Three concentric buffer zones around the quarry site

3. Spatial Overlay and Impact Analysis:
- Used "Select by Location" and "Spatial Join" tools to identify features within each buffer:
  - Number of houses inside each buffer
  - Villages intersected by each buffer
  - Rivers within or crossing buffer zones

4. Recorded the Following Observations:
- 500 m buffer:
  - High impact zone
  - Direct exposure to noise, dust, vibration
  - River contamination likely from runoff
- 1 km buffer:
  - Moderate impact zone
  - Possible noise and air pollution exposure
  - Psychological effects and livestock disturbance
- 2 km buffer:
  - Extended influence zone
  - Affects access roads, farmlands, and water catchments

5. Output:
- Created a map showing all three buffer zones in concentric rings
- Overlaid with houses, rivers, and villages
- Calculated and annotated:
  - Number of houses affected in each zone
  - Number of rivers/villages intersected

6. Use in Policy and Justice Analysis:
- These zones were used to inform the Environmental Justice Score (EJS)
- Helped justify the need for mitigation measures and environmental alerts in future planning

Notes:
- Buffering does not account for wind direction or topography
- Results represent potential influence zones, not direct pollution measurement
- Ideal for decision-makers and local risk communication
